# OmicsPLS

Welcome to the OmicsPLS package page on Github! It contains an implementation of O2PLS.

O2PLS is designed for integrating two high dimensional datasets and the O2PLS package is an implementation of this method.

Install the package with:

    devtools::install_github("selbouhaddani/OmicsPLS")
    library(OmicsPLS)

If that doesn't work, try the source .tar.gz or the Windows binaries .zip at my ZippedPackages repo.

For questions, complaints, bugs, etc, you can mail me or file an issue.

When using the OmicsPLS R-package in your research, please cite the corresponding article by running command 

    citation("OmicsPLS")

or copy-paste:

# Updates

- A new name is given: OmicsPLS! All function names are the same. I hope the inconvenience is minimal, my apologies.
- We are working on a software tutorial paper and vignette to appear soon! In the meantime just email me for more information on the package.
